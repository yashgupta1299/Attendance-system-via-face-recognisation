#Attendance System using Face-recognisation

-> Attendance system which keeps a record of entry, exit, and instance of a person present at a particular place
   with the help of a supervised learning algorithm. It can detect multiple faces at the same time.

-> First open face_data_collect.py then enter a name of a person then it collects the data via camera
   NOTE: use at least 50 image count for better accuracy, image count will going to appear in the terminal
   Then press q to exit the program.

-> Repeat the above process on whom you want to collect the data for marking attendance.

-> run face_recognisation.py for marking the attendance and it will also identify the face of a person and put their name on it.
